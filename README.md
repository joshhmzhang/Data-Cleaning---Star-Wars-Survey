# Data-Cleaning---Star-Wars-Survey

This is a survey launched by FiveThirtyEight. They surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey.The data could be downloaded from [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).

There are several columns containing answers to questions about the Star Wars movies. For some questions, the respondent had to check one or more boxes. This type of data is difficult to represent in columnar format. As a result, this data set needs a lot of cleaning.
